"""Server-owned Real-Time Chunking for G2 pi0.5 (Anvil-style), over one websocket.

Port of anvil-embodied-ai ``lerobot_control/inference_node.py`` (LeRobot 0.5.1 RTC):
the server owns the action queue, the inference worker and the execution clock, and
sends ONE absolute command per control tick. The client only streams observations
and executes (or holds) the latest command; authority, limits and stop stay with it.

Same as Anvil
  * worker infers whenever ``qsize <= queue_threshold`` (threshold = chunk -> continuous),
    at most once per observation, with the full unexecuted leftover as the RTC prefix;
  * RTC delay = ceil(max(last 5 guided latencies) * f), merge delay = rows really
    consumed while the request was in flight (wall-clock bounded, fail-closed);
  * readiness: discard warm-up, seed unguided (no publish), then 5 consecutive guided
    refills must pass coverage / projected-age / useful-overlap before POLICY_READY;
  * watchdog: stale observations, empty queue after ready, stale or misaligned refill,
    unguided refill after ready -> LATCHED (epoch bump, queue replaced, publishing
    stops). ``rearm`` needs fresh observations and repeats the whole readiness proof;
  * fresh diffusion noise per call, EXP prefix schedule.

Different from Anvil, forced by the model
  * The G2 configs predict arms/waist as deltas from the current state (grippers
    absolute). The queue therefore holds ABSOLUTE rows and Policy.infer re-anchors the
    leftover to the current state through the config's own input transforms on every
    refill (LeRobot 0.6.1 ``reanchor_relative_rtc_prefix``). Anvil's checkpoint is
    absolute, so it feeds the normalized original rows back instead; with absolute
    rows one queue serves both roles.
  * Only Pi0/pi0.5 models: ACoT's coarse head cannot take an RTC prefix.

Wire protocol (msgpack; one client at a time)
  client -> server
    {"type": "obs", "params": {images, states, prompt, task_name, robot_type}, "tick": bool}
        ``params`` is the corobot ``infer`` params block. ``tick`` is only used with
        clock="external" (simulation): it advances the execution clock by one step and
        is always answered with that step's cmd or status.
    {"type": "rearm"}   leave LATCHED; needs fresh observations, restarts readiness
    {"type": "reset"}   new episode: drop the queue and restart readiness (no fault)
    Both are answered with a status message.
  server -> client
    {"type": "cmd", "seq", "epoch", "t_server", "action_age_s", "queue", "action": [W]}
        ``action`` is one absolute row in the policy layout (gseries: arms 0:14,
        grippers 14:16, waist 16:21).
